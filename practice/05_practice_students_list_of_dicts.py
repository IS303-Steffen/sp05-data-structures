OPTIONAL AI GUIDANCE PROMPT:
----------------------------
I am a student in an introductory Python class. I am learning many coding
principles for the very first time. I am going to paste in the instructions to
a practice problem that my professor gave me to try before class. Please be my
kind tutor and walk me through how to solve the problem step by step.

Don't just give me the full solution all at once (unless I later ask for it).
Instead, help me work through it gradually, with clear explanations and small,
easy-to-understand examples. Please use everyday language and explain things
in a simple, friendly way.


INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
You're building a list of student dictionaries for a small class.

1. Create a dictionary for student1 with keys: "name", "major"
2. Create a dictionary for student2 with the same keys.
3. Put both dictionaries into a list called `students`.
4. Print the entire list.
5. Print the major of the second student in the list.
